                <h2>Food</h2>

                <p>
                    Food is any substance consumed by an organism for nutritional support. Food is usually of plant, animal,
                    or fungal origin and contains essential nutrients such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins,
                    or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells 
                    to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth. Different species of animals have different
                    feeding behaviours that satisfy the needs of their metabolisms and have evolved to fill a specific
                    ecological niche within specific geographical contexts.
                    Omnivorous humans are highly adaptable.

                <h2>Water</h2>

                <p>
                Water is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula H2O. It is a transparent, tasteless, odorless,
                and nearly colorless chemical substance, and it is the main constituent of Earth's hydrosphere and the
                fluids of all known living organisms (in which it acts as a solvent). It is vital for all known forms
                of life, despite not providing food energy or organic micronutrients. Its chemical formula, H2O,
                indicates that each of its molecules contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, connected by
                covalent bonds. The hydrogen atoms are attached to the oxygen atom at an angle of 104.45°.

                <h2>Drink</h2>

                <p>
                    Wine is an alcoholic beverage, which is produced by the fermentation of grapes and other fruits. Wine is not only
                    cultivated to produce Wine of different colours such as Red Wine, White Wine and Rosé (even Green in Portugal’s
                    Algarve) but also comes in a myriad of varieties which are created by blending different grapes with various
                    yeast strains to develop new and innovative wine species. Wine production can be traced back to the Caucasus
                    and the northern edge o. Drinks can take different forms such as wine, beverages, cocktail and carbonated drinks.
